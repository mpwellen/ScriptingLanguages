<p id="toWatch">The giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), also known 
as the ant bear, is a large insectivorous mammal native to Central and 
South America. It is one of four living species of anteaters and is 
classified with sloths in the order Pilosa. This species is mostly 
terrestrial, in contrast to other living anteaters and sloths, which 
are arboreal or semi-arboreal. The giant anteater is the largest of 
its family, 182–217 cm (5.97–7.12 ft) in length, with weights of 
33–41 kg (73–90 lb) for males and 27–39 kg (60–86 lb) for females. 
It is recognizable by its elongated snout, bushy tail, long fore claws, 
and distinctively colored pelage.</p>
